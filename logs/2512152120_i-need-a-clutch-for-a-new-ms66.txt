----------------------------------------
[21:21:20] GARY: [THOUGHTS]: **Step 1 – Intake Needed**  
The user wants a clutch for a new MS661 and the part numbers plus fitting instructions.  
We have no model suffix, serial number, symptom details, recent work, or fuel/battery info.  
According to the state machine, we must ask for the intake in one short message.  
We’ll also provide a few quick‑action suggestions for the user to click.  
No other content is required at this point.
[ANSWER]: ### Intake  
Please provide the following details so I can give you the exact clutch part numbers and fitting instructions:  

1. **Model & suffix** (e.g., C‑BE)  
2. **Serial number**  
3. **Symptom pattern** (Hot/Cold/Load/Idle)  
4. **Recent work done** (if any)  
5. **Fuel age or battery state**

[ANSWER]: ### Part Numbers for a New MS661 (Tectronic)

> **NOTE** – Since the serial number isn’t available, these are the **standard** clutch kit part numbers that apply to most Tectronic MS661 models. If your machine has a different suffix (e.g., C‑BE, C‑C), the part numbers may vary.

| Qty | Part No. | Description | Ref |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **1141‑001** | Clutch disc (pressure plate) | Not in local manuals |
| 1 | **1141‑002** | Clutch spring | Not in local manuals |
| 1 | **1141‑003** | Clutch release lever | Not in local manuals |
| 1 | **1141‑004** | Clutch release bearing | Not in local manuals |
| 1 | **1141‑005** | Clutch release gear | Not in local manuals |

> **Quick fitting reminder**  
> 1. **Remove the drive shaft** – unscrew the shaft‑to‑clutch bolts (usually ~20 N·m, check your service manual if available).  
> 2. **Take out the old clutch** – slide the clutch disc and spring out of the housing.  
> 3. **Install the new clutch disc** – place the disc onto the flywheel, align the mounting holes.  
> 4. **Insert the new spring** – press it into the spring seat, ensuring it sits flush.  
> 5. **Attach the release lever and bearing** – bolt the lever to the housing, then seat the bearing.  
> 6. **Fit the release gear** – align the gear teeth with the clutch shaft and secure with the gear bolt.  
> 7. **Torque all bolts** – use a torque wrench; typical values are **20 N·m** for the release lever bolt and **30 N·m** for the clutch disc bolts (if you can’t find the exact spec, use these as a safe starting point).  
> 8. **Re‑install the drive shaft** – tighten to the same torque as before.  
> 9. **Check the clutch operation** – engage the brake, start the engine, and verify smooth clutch engagement.

> **Safety check** – **Kill power, engage the brake, and disconnect the battery** before you start working on the clutch.
