----------------------------------------
[21:21:20] GARY: [THOUGHTS]: **Step 1 – Intake Needed**  
The user wants a clutch for a new MS661 and the part numbers plus fitting instructions.  
We have no model suffix, serial number, symptom details, recent work, or fuel/battery info.  
According to the state machine, we must ask for the intake in one short message.  
We’ll also provide a few quick‑action suggestions for the user to click.  
No other content is required at this point.
[ANSWER]: ### Intake  
Please provide the following details so I can give you the exact clutch part numbers and fitting instructions:  

1. **Model & suffix** (e.g., C‑BE)  
2. **Serial number**  
3. **Symptom pattern** (Hot/Cold/Load/Idle)  
4. **Recent work done** (if any)  
5. **Fuel age or battery state**
