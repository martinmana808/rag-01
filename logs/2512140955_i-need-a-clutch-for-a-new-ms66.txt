[ANSWER]: ### Intake Request
Hey, to give you the exact clutch part numbers and fitting steps for your MS661, I’ll need a few details:

1. **Model & suffix** (e.g., C‑BE, C‑C, etc.)  
2. **Serial number** (if you have it).  
3. **Symptom pattern** – is it a hot‑start, cold‑start, load‑issue, idle‑problem, etc.?  
4. **Recent work done** – have you removed the clutch before, or is this a brand‑new machine?  
5. **Fuel age or battery state** – fresh fuel or a new battery?

Once I have that, I can pull the exact part list and give you the step‑by‑step fitting instructions.
