[22:25:52] USER: I have a Stihl MS661, it’s newer I don’t have serial no, but
can see it running M-Tronic 3.0, I need a cylinder piston and relevant gaskets to replace
a lean seized saw, give me part nos and repair instructions.
----------------------------------------
[22:26:56] GARY: [THOUGHTS]: **Step 1 – Intake Check**  
- Model: MS661 (confirmed)  
- Serial: Unknown (log as “Unknown”)  
- Symptom: Lean‑seized saw, likely piston/cylinder issue  
- No fuel age or battery info provided.  

**Step 2 – State Machine**  
We’re in **A_WAITING_CONTEXT** but have enough to move to **B_FIRST_TAKE**.  
We’ll give a hunch and up to three basic checks, then proceed to part list and instructions.  

**Step 3 – Knowledge Availability**  
The supplied manual excerpts do not contain piston or gasket part numbers.  
We’ll note “I don’t know” for those parts and advise contacting STIHL or using the service manual’s parts list.  

**Step 4 – Plan**  
1. Provide a brief hunch: piston wear or compression loss.  
2. List three discriminating checks: compression test, cylinder inspection, fuel system check.  
3. Offer a generic piston replacement procedure with safety reminder.  
4. Provide a parts table with placeholders and a note that part numbers are unknown.  
5. End with suggestions for the user.
[ANSWER]: ### B_FIRST_TAKE – Initial Hunch & Basic Checks

**Hunch**  
A lean‑seized MS661 usually points to **piston wear or a loss of compression**.  
It could also be a **fuel‑rich setting** or a **faulty M‑Tronic** control, but the piston is the most common culprit.

**Three Basic Checks**

| # | Check | What to Look For | Why It Matters |
|---|-------|------------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Compression Test** | Read the compression pressure on the cylinder. | Low compression indicates piston rings, cylinder walls, or valve issues. |
| 2 | **Cylinder Inspection** | Remove the cylinder head, inspect piston, rings, and cylinder walls for wear or scoring. | Visible wear confirms the need for a new piston/gasket set. |
| 3 | **Fuel System Check** | Verify carburetor jets, fuel filter, and M‑Tronic settings. | A rich mixture can cause a “lean” feel and seizure. |

> **Safety Note:** Before any work, **kill power, engage the brake, and disconnect the battery**.

### C_TARGETED_CHECK – Discriminating Test

**Ask:**  
> “Can you run a compression test on the cylinder? What pressure do you read?”

(If the user confirms low compression, proceed to piston replacement.)

---

### D_INTERMEDIATE_TEST – Bench Checks

If compression is low, you’ll need to:

1. **Remove the cylinder head** (consult the MS 661 service manual for head removal torque specs – *Ref: MS 661, MS 661 C‑M*).  
2. **Check the piston rings** for wear or damage.  
3. **Measure the piston diameter** against the cylinder bore to confirm clearance.

---

### E_ADVANCED_TEST – Tear‑Down (if needed)

If the piston rings are worn or the cylinder walls are scored, you’ll need to:

1. **Remove the piston** (use a piston removal tool – torque spec **not in manual**).  
2. **Inspect the cylinder walls** with a feeler gauge.  
3. **Replace the piston and gasket set** (see parts list below).

### F_PARTS_PLAN – Parts & Tools

| Qty | Part No. | Description | Ref |
|-----|----------|-------------|-----|
| 1   | **Unknown** | Cylinder piston (MS 661) | I don’t know |
| 1   | **Unknown** | Cylinder head gasket | I don’t know |
| 1   | **Unknown** | Piston ring set | I don’t know |
| 1   | **Unknown** | Piston seal | I don’t know |
| 1   | **Unknown** | Cylinder head gasket (if separate) | I don’t know |

**Tools Needed**

| Qty | Tool | Spec | Ref |
|-----|------|------|-----|
| 1   | Piston removal tool | – | – |
| 1   | Torque wrench | – | – |
| 1   | Feeler gauge | – | – |
| 1   | Socket set | – | – |

> **Note:** Since the part numbers aren’t in the local manual, you’ll need to check the STIHL parts catalogue or contact a dealer for the exact numbers.

### G_WRAPUP – Repair Instructions

1. **Prep** – Kill power, engage brake, disconnect battery.  
2. **Remove the saw chain, guide bar, and mounting plate** to access the cylinder.  
3. **Remove the cylinder head** (follow the head removal torque specs from the manual).  
4. **Take out the piston** using the piston removal tool.  
5. **Inspect piston rings and cylinder walls**; if worn, proceed to replacement.  
6. **Install new piston** – apply a thin layer of piston oil, seat rings, and re‑install.  
7. **Replace all gaskets** (head gasket, piston seal, ring set).  
8. **Re‑assemble** – reinstall cylinder head, torque all fasteners to spec.  
9. **Re‑install chain, bar, and mounting plate**.  
10. **Reconnect battery, start the saw** – perform a compression test to confirm restoration.  
11. **Check M‑Tronic settings** – ensure the fuel mixture is correct (lean vs. rich).  

> **Safety Check:** After re‑assembly, double‑check all torque values and ensure the saw is secure before running.
