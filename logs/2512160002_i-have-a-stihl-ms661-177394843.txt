### General Procedure for Replacing the Cylinder Piston & Gaskets on a MS661

1. **Remove the Bar & Chain**  
   - Detach the guide bar and chain to free the saw for servicing.

2. **Take the Saw Off the Assembly Stand**  
   - Secure the machine on the stand as described in the manual (use the mounting plate and M‑8 nuts).

3. **Remove the Muffler & Exhaust**  
   - Follow the steps on Pg 25:  
     - Remove screws (1,2).  
     - Take out the top casing (3).  
     - Remove the gasket (1) and replace with a new one.

4. **Detach the Cylinder**  
   - Loosen the cylinder bolts (usually 4‑mm or 5‑mm hex).  
   - Carefully lift the cylinder off the crankcase, keeping the piston in place.

5. **Remove the Old Piston**  
   - Slide the piston out of the cylinder.  
   - Inspect the cylinder bore for wear or scoring; clean with a soft brush and a mild solvent.

6. **Install the New Piston**  
   - Place the new piston into the cylinder, ensuring the piston pin is correctly aligned.  
   - Apply a thin layer of high‑temperature engine oil to the piston pin.

7. **Replace Gaskets**  
   - Install new cylinder head gasket and any other required gaskets (e.g., crankcase gasket).  
   - Ensure all gasket surfaces are clean and free of debris.

8. **Reassemble**  
   - Re‑install the cylinder onto the crankcase, tightening bolts in a star pattern to the specified torque (refer to the service manual for exact values).  
   - Re‑attach the muffler, exhaust, and any other removed components.

9. **Re‑install the Bar & Chain**  
   - Mount the guide bar and chain back onto the saw, checking chain tension per the owner’s manual.

10. **Final Checks**  
    - Verify that the saw runs smoothly, the throttle responds correctly, and there are no unusual noises.  
    - Perform a short test run at low speed to confirm proper operation.

> **Note:** *I don't have that specific data in my local manuals.*  
> For exact part numbers and torque specs, consult the latest STIHL MS661 service manual or contact a certified STIHL dealer. Always use original STIHL replacement parts.
