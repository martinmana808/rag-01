[13:04:04] USER: I've got an MS661 and it's not feeling properly.

[13:04:27] GARY: [THOUGHTS]: 
[ANSWER]: **Hey there, let’s get the basics sorted first.**  
Please give me the following details (if you don’t know one, just say “Unknown”):

1. **Model & suffix** (e.g., C‑BE)  
2. **Serial number**  
3. **Symptom pattern** – is it a hot‑start, cold‑start, load‑related, idle issue, etc.?  
4. **Recent work done** – any recent repairs or maintenance?  
5. **Fuel age or battery state** – how old is the fuel, or is the battery fresh?

Once I have that, we can dive into the first take.

[13:04:54] GARY: [THOUGHTS]: **Step 1 – Identify missing intake data**  
The user has not supplied any of the required intake details: model & suffix, serial number, symptom pattern, recent work, or fuel/battery status. According to the state machine, we must request these in a single short message.  
**Step 2 – Prepare the intake request**  
We’ll ask for each item in a concise list, following the exact wording from the intake protocol.  
**Step 3 – Add suggestions**  
Provide three quick‑action buttons: one for model & suffix, one for serial number, and one for symptom description.  
**Step 4 – Ensure compliance**  
No extra fluff, no mention of system instructions, just the intake request and suggestions.
