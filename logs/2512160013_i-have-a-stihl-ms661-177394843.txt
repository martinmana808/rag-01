[ANSWER]: ### Repair Instructions – Cylinder Piston & Gaskets (MS661 M‑Tronic 3.0)

**Safety first:**  
> **Kill power, disconnect battery, and engage the brake.**  
> Keep the saw on a stable surface and use a jack stand if needed.

1. **Remove the saw chain, bar, and guide** – keep them in a clean area.  
2. **Detach the muffler** (see manual page 25).  
   - Loosen the screws, remove the top casing, and set aside.  
3. **Remove the cylinder head** – unscrew the head bolts, lift the head off, and set aside.  
4. **Take out the piston** – lift it out of the cylinder.  
5. **Inspect the cylinder walls** for scoring or wear.  
6. **Replace the piston** – slide the new piston into the cylinder.  
7. **Install new gaskets** –  
   - **Cylinder head gasket** (new each time).  
   - **Cylinder‑piston gasket** (if separate).  
   - **Muffler gasket** (if applicable).  
8. **Re‑assemble** –  
   - Place the cylinder head back on, tighten bolts in the specified sequence.  
   - Re‑attach the muffler, chain, bar, and guide.  
9. **Check compression** – use a compression gauge; it should be within spec.  
10. **Re‑install the battery, start the saw, and test for smooth operation.**

> **Tip:** If the saw was “lean” and seized, also inspect the carburetor jets and adjust the fuel mixture per the M‑Tronic tuning chart (page 16 of the repair manual).

**I don't have that specific data in my local manuals.**  
If you need the exact part numbers, you’ll have to check the latest STIHL parts catalogue or contact a dealer.
