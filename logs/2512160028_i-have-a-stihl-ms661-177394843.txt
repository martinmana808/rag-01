[00:28:23] USER: I have a Stihl MS661, 177394843 serial no, but can see it running M-Tronic 3.0, I need a cylinder piston and relevant gaskets to replace a lean seized saw, give me part nos and repair instructions.

[00:28:49] GARY: [THOUGHTS]: 
[ANSWER]: **I’m sorry, but I don’t have the specific part numbers for the cylinder piston or the associated gaskets for the MS 661 in my local manuals.**  
I can still walk you through the general procedure for removing and reinstalling the piston, but you’ll need to source the correct parts from a STIHL dealer or the official parts catalogue.

### General Piston Removal & Re‑installation (M‑Tronic 3.0)

> **Safety first:**  
> • **Kill power** – disconnect the battery or remove the spark plug.  
> • **Engage the brake** and lock the saw in the neutral position.  
> • Work in a well‑ventilated area and wear eye protection.

#### 1. Remove the Engine Cover & Muffler
1. Unscrew the engine cover screws (usually 4 × 10 mm).  
2. Lift the cover and set aside.  
3. Remove the muffler by loosening the mounting bolts (typically 4 × 12 mm).  
4. Keep the gasket in a clean container; you’ll need a new one.

#### 2. Access the Cylinder
1. Detach the fuel line and throttle linkage.  
2. Remove the spark plug and note its orientation.  
3. Loosen the cylinder head bolts (usually 4 × 12 mm).  
4. Carefully lift the cylinder off the crankcase.  
5. Inspect the cylinder for scoring or wear; replace if necessary.

#### 3. Remove the Piston
1. With the cylinder removed, locate the piston.  
2. Use a piston removal tool or a long‑shank screwdriver to push the piston out of the cylinder.  
3. Inspect the piston for wear or damage.  
4. If the piston is seized, you may need a piston puller or a small hammer and a pry bar – be gentle to avoid cracking the cylinder.

#### 4. Install the New Piston
1. Apply a thin layer of engine oil to the piston ring(s).  
2. Slide the new piston into the cylinder, ensuring the ring(s) sit correctly.  
3. Re‑install the cylinder onto the crankcase, tightening the head bolts in a star pattern to the specified torque (if known).  
4. Re‑attach the spark plug, fuel line, and throttle linkage.

#### 5. Re‑assemble
1. Install a new gasket on the muffler and re‑attach it.  
2. Replace the engine cover and secure it.  
3. Re‑connect the battery or spark plug.  
4. Perform a compression test (should be within spec for the MS 661).  
5. Start the saw and check for smooth operation; adjust the M‑Tronic settings if needed.

- **Contact a STIHL dealer** or check the official STIHL parts catalogue for the exact piston and gasket part numbers for the MS 661.  
- If you have the service manual’s part list, look for the “Cylinder Piston” section; the part number will be listed there.  
- Once you have the part numbers, you can order them directly from STIHL or a reputable parts supplier.
