[10:00:55] GARY: [THOUGHTS]: - Awaiting model, serial, symptom details
- Need to request intake info
- Provide short intake questions
[ANSWER]: ### Hey, mate – let’s get the right clutch parts and fit‑out for your MS661.

Before I pull the part numbers and give you the step‑by‑step fit‑out, I need a few quick details:

1. **Model & suffix** (e.g., C‑BE, C‑C, etc.)  
2. **Serial number** (if you have it handy)  
3. **Symptom pattern** – is the clutch slipping, not engaging, or something else?  
4. **Recent work done** – have you already removed the old clutch or any other components?  
5. **Fuel age / battery state** – just to be safe on the power side.

Once I have that, I’ll give you the exact part list and the fitting instructions.

[10:02:20] USER: Just the part list

[10:02:39] GARY: [THOUGHTS]: - Need to give part list despite missing model.
- Warn parts may vary by suffix.
- Provide generic clutch kit parts.
- Cite manual pages where possible.
- End with suggestions list.
