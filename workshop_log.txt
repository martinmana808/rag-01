[2025-12-12 19:18:52] USER: MS 661 C-M — 10 Minute Hot Stall


----------------------------------------
[2025-12-12 19:19:10] GARY: [THOUGHT]: 
[ANSWER]: Sure thing. I need a bit more info before I can dig in:

- **Serial number**  
- **Any recent work** (e.g., cleaning, part changes, tuning)  
- **Fuel age / battery condition**  

Drop those details in and we’ll get started.

[2025-12-12 19:19:25] USER: Sorry that is all /i got. I dont have the serial.

[ANSWER]: Got it – MS 661 C‑M.  
Could you give me:

- **Serial number**  
- **Any recent work** (cleaning, part swaps, tuning, etc.)  
- **Fuel age** or **battery condition** (if battery‑start)  

Thanks!

[2025-12-12 19:26:26] USER: Hey Gary, MS 661 isn't oiling.


----------------------------------------
[2025-12-12 19:26:41] GARY: Hey there! To get to the bottom of why the MS 661 isn’t oiling, I’ll need a few quick details. Could you let me know:

- **Model & suffix** (e.g., MS 661‑AR, MS 661‑C, etc.)  
- **Serial number** (if you have it; if not, just say “Unknown”)  
- **Symptom pattern** – e.g., does it fail to start, stalls, runs rough, etc.?  
- **Recent work done** – any recent repairs, part replacements, or maintenance?  
- **Fuel age** or **battery state** (new, used, age, etc.)  

Thanks, and we’ll tackle this from there!

I dont have the serial/ 
It doesnt oil, it stalls hot 10minutes.

[2025-12-12 19:27:50] GARY: **Acknowledge the missing serial & warn about part variability**

> *Serial number unknown – some parts (e.g., seals, pressure test fittings) may differ slightly between early & later batches, but the core procedure stays the same.*

### B\_FIRST\_TAKE  
**Hunch:** The oil supply is being blocked or the oil pump is not priming properly, so when the engine heats up the suction system can’t keep up.  

**Three basic checks to start with**

| # | Check | What to look for | Reference |
|---|-------|------------------|-----------|
| 1 | **Oil level & condition** | Fill the tank to the “Full” mark. Look for sludge or water contamination that could clog the suction hose or filter. | Ref: MS 661‑AR p.95 “Pickup Body Impurities gradually clog the fine pores of the filter…” |
| 2 | **Oil suction hose & pickup body** | Inspect the hose for kinks, cuts or blockages. Remove the pickup body, clean it and reinstall. Ensure the hose is fully seated on the pump. | Ref: MS 661‑AR p.95 “Remove the oil suction hose (1) together with the pickup body” |
| 3 | **Oil pump pressure test** | With the engine off, connect the pressure gauge to the crankcase inlet, raise the pressure to **0.5 bar** (vacuum 0.5 bar) as specified, and hold for 20 s. If pressure drops, locate leaks. | Ref: MS 661‑AR p.27 “Operate the lever until the pressure gauge indicates a pressure of 0.5 bar” |

**Safety reminder**:  
> **Kill power, engage the brake, and make sure the machine is on a stable surface before opening the tank or working on the pump.**

Let me know the results of these checks, and we’ll keep moving.

[2025-12-12 19:29:28] GARY: ### C_TARGETED_CHECK  

**Discriminating test to isolate the problem:**

> **Run the engine on a bench and read the oil‑pressure gauge at the crankcase outlet while the machine is running.**  
> - **If the gauge reads 0 bar or very low (under 0.2 bar) during operation, the oil pump is not delivering pressure – the pump or its drive is at fault.**  
> - **If the gauge rises to the expected pressure range (≈ 0.5–0.8 bar) when running, the pump is fine and the issue is likely a blockage downstream (filter, hose, pickup body).**

**Steps to perform the test**

1. **Safety first:** Kill power, engage the brake, and secure the machine on a stable bench or platform.  
2. **Attach the pressure gauge** to the crankcase outlet fitting (the gauge socket shown in the manual, Pg 27).  
3. **Turn on the machine** and let it run at a steady idle (no load).  
4. **Observe the gauge** for at least 30 seconds.  
5. **Record the reading** and note whether it stays at zero, rises, or fluctuates.

Once you’ve got that reading, let me know and we’ll decide on the next move.
